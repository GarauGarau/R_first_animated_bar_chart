Animated Bar Chart of COVID-19 Cases in Italy's Regions

This code is an initial attempt to create an animated bar chart using COVID-19 data in Italy provided by the Civil Protection Agency. The code builds on a solution posted on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53162821/animated-sorted-bar-chart-with-bars-overtaking-each-other
Required Libraries

The following libraries are required to run this code:

    dplyr
    readr
    zoo
    ggplot2
    gganimate
    gifski
    tidyverse

Data

The COVID-19 data for Italy's regions is obtained from the following URL:
"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19/master/dati-regioni/dpc-covid19-ita-regioni.csv"
Code Description

The code loads the required libraries and reads in the COVID-19 data for Italy's regions. It then organizes the data and assigns a ranking to each region based on the number of total cases. The code also corrects the region names to make them more readable.

The code then creates an animated bar chart using ggplot2 and gganimate libraries. The bar chart shows the ranking of regions based on the number of total cases, with each region represented by a colored bar. The bar chart also displays the number of total cases for each region and the region names. The chart is animated, showing how the ranking of regions changes over time.

The code generates two output files:

    "gganim.gif": a GIF animation of the bar chart
    "output.mp4": an MP4 video of the bar chart

Disclaimer

Please note that the code is an initial attempt to create an animated bar chart and may require modifications to meet specific needs. The data used is also subject to change and should be updated accordingly.
